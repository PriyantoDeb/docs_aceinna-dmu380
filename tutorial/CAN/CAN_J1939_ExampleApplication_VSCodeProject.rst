VSCode project for the J1939 CAN IMU Example Application
--------------------------------------------------------

The *IMU* project for OpenIMU300RI is the example which implements basic IMU functionality and transmits calibrated sensors data over CAN bus using J1939 protocol.

*   The most important files are found in the bottom level 'include', 'include/API', 'lib/J1939/include', 'lib/J1939/src', 'src', and  'src/user' directories.
*   These directories provide the user visible and modifiable files, including the example application code and the
    header files that provide the function prototypes for the user and library code and critical definitions.
*   The directory structure and files are shown in the following screen capture from VSCode.
